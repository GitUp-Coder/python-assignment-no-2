#Pop method You have a list named items with the elements [10, 20, 30, 40]. If you use the pop method without any arguments, what will the list look like and what value will be removed?



#Answer : the value removed will be 40, and the list will look like [10, 20, 30].

items = [10, 20, 30, 40]
removed_value = items.pop()  
print(removed_value) 
print(items)
